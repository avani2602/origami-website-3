            <h2>WHAT IS ORIGAMI</h2>
            
            Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami <br>
            (“paper”). Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a <br>
            colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.
