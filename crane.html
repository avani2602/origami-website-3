            <h4>Make your very own flying origami cranes by following these simple steps.</h4>

            <div class = "steps">
            <img src = "cranes1.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>1. Using a square piece of paper, fold the paper in half to form a triangle. If using a<br>
            piece of paper colored on one side only, begin with the colored side facing up. Unfold<br>
            the paper and repeat to make folds seen in the image above.</p>
            
            <img src = "cranes2.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>2. Flip the paper so the colored side is facing down and fold the paper in half forming a<br>
            rectangle. Unfold the paper and repeat to make folds seen in the image above.</p>
            
            <img src = "cranes3.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>3. Now fold along all four creases at once to form a square with the open end facing you.</p>
            
            <img src = "cranes4.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>4. Fold two edges in, to form a kite-shape on top. Repeat on other side.</p>
            
            <img src = "cranes5.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>5. Fold the point down and crease above the other two folds. Flip the paper and repeat fold.<br>
            Undo the folds you made in steps 4 and 5.</p>
            
            <img src = "cranes6.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>6. Pull the bottom corner (top layer only) up above the top corner. Fold along the creases you<br>
            made in steps 4 and 5. Repeat on the other side.</p>
            
            <img src = "cranes7.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>7. Fold two edges in to form a kite-shape. Repeat on the other side.</p>
            
            <img src = "cranes8.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>8. Fold the top layer (right side) to lay on top of the left side like turning the page of a book.<br>
            Flip over and repeat on the other side.</p>
            
            <img src = "cranes9.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>9. Fold up the top layer as far as you can on each side.</p>

            <img src = "cranes10.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>10. Fold the top layer (right side) to lay on top of the left side like turning the page of a book.<br>
             Flip over and repeat on the other side.</p>

            <img src = "cranes11.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>11. Fold down wings.</p>

            <img src = "cranes12.png" width = 300 height = 300/>
            <p>12. Bend down the head to give the crane a long beak. Pull the wings straight out from the body so that<br>
            the body inflates.</p>
