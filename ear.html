            <div class = "steps">
            <img src = "ear1.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>1. Fold Paper in Half
            <ol># Start with your paper pointed diagonally, so it's the shape of a diamond. Fold your paper in half, taking the bottom corner<br>
            up to the top corner and press. Unfold.</ol>
            <ol># Fold the right corner over to the left corner and crease well. Unfold. You now have a horizontal crease and a vertical crease.<br>
            Flip the paper over to the other side.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "ear2.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>2. Fold All Corners
            <ol># Next, fold all of the corners to the middle and crease well.</ol>
            <ol># Now fold all of the inner corners outward, aligning with the horizontal and vertical creases.</ol>
            <ol># Flip the paper over to the other side. Fold the paper in half diagonally, creating a set of creases that form an X.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "ear3.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>3. Bring Bottom Edge Up
            <ol># Bring the bottom edge up to meet the central crease and fold just the middle section, then open out again.</ol>
            <ol># Rotate the paper and fold each of the other three sides in the same way—you will now have a square-shaped crease in the middle.</ol>
            <ol># Pinch all four corners together—the creases are already made.</ol>
            <ol># Keep pinching the corners and push the edges into the middle and flatten them.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "ear4.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>4. Push Corners
            <ol># Push the corners, so they become flattened, and arrange them in the shape of a pinwheel.</ol>
            <ol># Flip the model over to the back. Fold the bottom corner up, aligning it with the central horizontal crease and then unfold.</ol>
            <ol># Rotate the paper and repeat the last step on the other three sides. Fold the four triangles in half.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "ear5.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>5. Fold Corners Into Middle
            <ol># Pick up the paper and begin folding the corners into the middle.</ol>
            <ol># Starting with the lower corner, followed by the left, top and right. You can rotate the paper as you do this</ol>
            <ol># When you get to the last flap, tuck it underneath the first one.</ol>
            <ol># Spend some time flattening it out. If you've used thick paper, you might want to pop them inside a heavy book overnight, and they will be<br>
            flat in the morning!</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "ear6.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>6. Bend Eye Pins
            <ol># Grab your eye pins and your pliers. Use your pliers to bend the eye pins as shown in the photos. Each eye pin should look like a tiny coat<br>
            hanger.</ol>
            </p>

            <p>7. Fold Corners Into Middle
            <ol># Open out one of the flaps on the back of the origami square. Insert the little 'hanger' and then close the flap again.</ol>
            <ol># You can use glue to make the earring more secure–especially if the paper is soft. Next, attach the loop to an earring wire or stud of your choice.</ol>
