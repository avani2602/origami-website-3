            <h2>WHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT THEM?</h2>

            Making an origami elephant is not only a really cool craft skill, but it makes for a great present <br>
            for your favorite origami lover. This is an intermediate-level origami project, made from a single<br>
            sheet of square paper. If you are a beginner at origami, you may find this project tricky, but it's <br>
            so cute, you won't regret learning how to do it.

            <h4>Make your very own origami elephant by following these simple steps.</h4>
            </div>

            <p>
            <div class = "steps">
            <img src = "eles1.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>1. The First Folds
            <ol># Start with your paper white side up, if it has one. Fold the paper in half, from left to right and then bottom to top. </ol>
            <ol># Next, fold the top and bottom edge to the horizontal central crease and unfold.</ol>
            <ol># Fold the left and right edges to the vertical central crease and unfold.</ol>
            <ol># You now have a neat grid of 15 equal sections.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "eles2.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>2. Rotate the Paper
            <ol># Rotate the paper so that it is a diamond. </ol>
            <ol># Fold the top, bottom and left corner to the central crease–not the right corner (keep this corner on the right side–this will become the elephant's head).</ol>
            <ol># Fold the bottom edge up to meet the top-most horizontal crease. Unfold.</ol>
            <ol># Repeat the last step, fold the top corner down to the lowest horizontal crease, and the right and left corners to their opposing creases.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "eles3.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>3. Flip and Fold
            <ol># Fold the paper as shown, creasing only where indicated. </ol>
            <ol># Repeat for the other diagonal crease.</ol>
            <ol># Flip the paper over, from top to bottom, keeping the right (uncreased) section on the right.</ol>
            <ol># Fold the left corner to the right, to the point indicated. For thick paper, avoid the middle diamond.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "eles4.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>4. Fold the Corners In
            <ol># Flip the paper over, from top to bottom. </ol>
            <ol># Repeat for the other diagonal crease.</ol>
            <ol># Fold the bottom right section diagonally up to the left, followed by the top right section.</ol>
            <ol># Fold the right section over to the left, squashing the diagonal folds you just made.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "eles5.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>5. Rotate and Fold
            <ol># Rotate the paper. </ol>
            <ol># Now you can grab the bottom section and flip it under and behind. The top flap will come down to the bottom.</ol>
            <ol># Next, you'll fold the left and right corners of the lower section to the central crease.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "eles6.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>6. The V-Shape Fold
            <ol># Flip the paper over to the other side. </ol>
            <ol># There is a V-shaped crease on the top of the front-most flap–these creases need to be re-folded as valley creases</ol>
            <ol># Flip the model over and rotate as shown.</ol>
            <ol># Fold the model in half, from top to bottom.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "eles7.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>7. Forming the Trunk
            <ol># Hold onto the elephant's trunk and the back of his head, push gently. A new crease will form. </ol>
            <ol># There should be a diamond shape on top of the elephant. Open out the bottom of the model and push on that diamond, flattening it.</ol>
            <ol># Pinch the diagonal edge that appears on the left.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "eles8.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>8. Shaping the Other Side
            <ol># Fold the flap over to the right.</ol>
            <ol># There is already a crease here; fold it over and tuck it behind.</ol>
            <ol># Now you need to repeat these steps on the other side of the elephant.</ol>
            <ol># Find the back of the elphant and pinch it, keeping that diamond intact.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "eles9.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>9. Forming Pleats
            <ol># Make a small, thin fold.</ol>
            <ol># Open the flap that was under the tail-end of the elephant.</ol>
            <ol># Hold it as shown.</ol>
            <ol># The left of the diamond shape needs to be folded into pleats over to the right.</ol>
            </p>

            <img src = "eles10.png" width = 400 height = 400/>
            <p>10. Finishing the Elephant
            <ol># Fold the top corner over and underneath the elephant. It will secure his "legs."</ol>
            <ol># Now you can shape the trunk however you like. You can fold it to be pointing up or down. After deciding, make a crease and then inside reverse fold it. Your origami elephant is now complete.</ol>
